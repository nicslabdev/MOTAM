# MOTAM - Gateway

MOTAM - Gateway repository contains the applications of the vehicle's gateway on MOTAM platform.

The gateway collects all the road state and vehicles information from MOTAM infraestructure. This data is analized, parsed and send by a secure connection to AVATAR Android application.

Another MOTAM related repositories and more info about MOTAM project can be found on:
> [**MOTAM project website by NICS.**](https://www.nics.uma.es/projects/motam)

## Hardware list
MOTAM Gateway is supported by Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. 
Several peripherals are attached to Raspberry Pi in order to collect different kind of data from the own car, near vehicles and Road Side Units.
The peripherals are listed below:

 - Raspberry Pi 7" Touch Display.
 - ELM327 OBD II Interface.
 - BU-353S4 USB GPS Receiver from GlobalSat.
 - UPS PIco HV3.0B from PiModules.
 - nRF52840 dongle from NordicSemiconductor.

## Usage
Just execute in Raspberry Pi terminal:

	cd ~/MOTAM-Gateway/
    sudo python3 startGateway.py
    
For help:

    sudo python3 startGateway.py --help
    
For Interactive Scanner mode (default location of beacons):

	sudo python3 startGateway.py --interactive

For Interactive Scanner mode and custom location coordinates of beacons:

	sudo python3 startGateway.py --interactive 36.715923 -4.477482

For capturing real data from OBDII and GPS receiver (must be connected to USB)

	sudo python3 startGateway.py --real_obd_gps

For loading a OBDII and GPS session trip (default session trip):

	sudo python3 startGateway.py --loadCarTrip

For loading an OBDII and GPS session trip (another session trip). The session trip must be located con simulation/sessions folder:

	sudo python3 startGateway.py --loadCarTrip alternativeSessionTrip.db

For loading an OBDII, GPS and captured beacons session trip (default trip):

	sudo python3 startGateway.py --loadCarTrip --loadBeaconsTrip

For using another type of vehicle (change certificate). Available: normal, emergency and slow vehicle:

	sudo python3 startGateway.py --cert pasarela_lento.crt

For capturing real BLE4 beacons with real receiver.

	sudo python3 startGateway.py --real_ble4

For capturing real BLE5 beacons with real receiver.

	sudo python3 startGateway.py --real_ble5

## Connection parameters
- Gateway IP direction: 192.168.0.1
- Gateway TLS port: 4443

## Simulation
MOTAM-Gateway can simulate a car trip in order to send simulated data to AVATAR app. 

It's possible to select the kind of data that is simulated and what data come from real sources. This may be useful for development and testing purpouses.

Here you can find a preloaded simulation of a car trip. The information is sent via Wifi Direct socket in JSON format.

Simulation has a duration of 155 seconds.

| Time (seconds) | Beacon data |
|--|--|
| 5 to 10 | Baby seat: No baby, not fastened |
| 10 to 15 | Baby seat: Baby, not fastened |
| 15 to 20 | Baby seat: Baby, fastened |
| 20 to 22 | Traffic light: green state (2 seconds left) |
| 23 to 25 | Traffic light: yellow state (2 seconds left) |
| 26 to 27 | Traffic light: red state (3 seconds left) |
| 30 to 40 | Emergency vehicle (from left side) |
| 50 to 60 | Crashed vehicle |

> The time is approximate and relative to the start of simulation

## Interactive Scanner mode

- Traffic light in yellow state.
- Traffic light in green state.
- Intelligent Traffic Light in red state 16 seconds left.
- Intelligent Traffic Light in yellow state 5 seconds left.
Intelligent Traffic Light in green state 29 seconds left.
- Dry road.
- Wet road.
- Frozen road.
- Bicycle in motion.
- Bicycle accident.
- Information panel "Incendio 2 Km"
- Information panel "Carrera ciclista"
- Pedestrian near.
- Slow Vehicle.
